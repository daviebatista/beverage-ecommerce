On this new version, I recreate this project's visual appearence and functionalities.
This project is a favorite of mine, since its first version was one of the first works on front-end development I've done when I started studying.
For that, I recreated it entirely, preserving the original idea, but giving the site a new mockup and new ways of working by itself.
With that, Old David's Shop is entirely remodeled with many new features and technologies.

You can also check the project's wireframe <a href="https://www.figma.com/file/FLaRgeOP2ZW6nzsXYzdVmS/Old-David's-Shop?type=design&node-id=101%3A2&t=QriODn1943bLBbum-1">here!</a>
